Stock Market Analysis and Prediction

Our goal is to develop software that will support technical stock analysis study 
and assist in machine learning model-based stock price prediction. assists users 
in identifying patterns of market trends and other circumstances. 
Technical research is the study of historical stock prices with the goal of 
predicting future price trends using characteristics that influence stock value. 
It displays the direction of the share prices' movement. You can determine if 
the share price will grow or decrease sharply with the use of technical research. 
These variables will be included into data mining methods, allowing us to 
determine which approach produces the best outcome. This will also assist us 
in estimating the future prices of that certain stock. We will use data mining 
methods to find patterns in the data.
