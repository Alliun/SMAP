 A stock market is an open marketplace for the purchase and sale of shares of 
publicly traded corporations. The equities, or stocks, stand for ownership 
stakes in the business. The intermediary that makes it possible to purchase and 
sell shares is the stock exchange. 
 Investors can determine a security's intrinsic value even before they purchase 
it by using stock market research. Prior to making an investment, research must 
be done. You cannot predict an investment's worth or future success until you 
have conducted extensive study. 
 One of the most popular uses of machine learning is stock price analysis, which 
has been a crucial field of study. 
 One type of time-series forecasting is Stock Market Prediction (SMP), which 
quickly analyses historical data and projects values for future data. A collection 
of data points indexed in time order is called a time series. Increasing earnings 
from stock trading is a crucial component of stock market forecasting. 
 Artificial intelligence, roughly defined as a machine's capacity to mimic 
intelligent human behaviour, includes machine learning as a subfield.
